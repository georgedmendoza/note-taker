  The application is started when the user visit the live link. From there the user can determine how many notes they would like to create and save. If a note needs to be deleted there is an option next to the each note to delete it.  Users can view all existing notes and open any note as long as they're not deleted. Once the note is deleted it can't be recovered. Currently the webpage is set up, so existing notes cannot be edited. A screenshot of the note-taker app is shown below.
